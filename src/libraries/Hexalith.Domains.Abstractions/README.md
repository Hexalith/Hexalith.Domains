# Hexalith.Domains.Abstractions

This library contains the core abstractions and interfaces for Domain Driven Design (DDD) in the Hexalith ecosystem. It defines the contract for domain models, events, and value objects.

## Key Concepts

- **Aggregates** (`IDomainAggregate`): Roots of trust and consistency boundaries.
- **Events**: Domain events representing something that happened in the past.
- **Results**: Standardized result types for domain operations.
- **Value Objects**: Immutable objects defined by their attributes rather than identity.
- **State Machines**: Support for state-based domain logic.
